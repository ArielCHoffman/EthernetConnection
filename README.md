# EthernetConnection
This is a basic ethernet connection. This is not currently functional.

The server.py file is responsible for setting up the socket on the python side. It worked just fine for a computer to computer connection. I tend to trust this code a bit.

The folder contains our project that goes on the board. It was largely generated by the cube MX gui and the parts for the connection are in src. The whole thing builds, but it doesn't work end-to-end. Every time we try to make a connection (using the same ip address as we used in the python script) it times out.
